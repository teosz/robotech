1) Give the right to non-root users to load programs to the nxt
---------------------------------------------------------------

for linuces using udev mechanism:
- copy (as root) the right .rules file to /etc/udev/rules.d/
LINUX-USB/70-lego.rules : used to work with debian < squeeze
LINUX-USB/71-lego.rules : new syntax (?) woks for debian = squeeze

2) Get rid of "cdc-acm"
-----------------------

This problem may appear in firmware-loading mode, a serial-device driver 
called "cdc-acm" captures the nxt, e.g. dmesg gives:

usb 4-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
usb 4-2: New USB device found, idVendor=03eb, idProduct=6124
usb 4-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
cdc_acm 4-2:1.0: This device cannot do calls on its own. It is not a modem.
cdc_acm 4-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_acm
cdc_acm: v0.26:USB Abstract Control Model driver for USB modems and ISDN adapters

Kick and DIRTY solution, as root:
  1) black-list cdc-acm:
  add the line:
blacklist cdc-acm
  to the file:
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

  2) kill cdc-acm (if running):
modprobe -r cdc-acm
